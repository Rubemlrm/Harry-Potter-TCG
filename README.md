Harry-Potter-TCG
================

A recreation of the old Harry Potter Trading Card Game developed (and sadly discontinued) by Wizards of the Coast. Planned features include random deck generation, AI opponents, and a basic tutorial.  Once the main features are in, focus will shift to adding more variety in cards through frequent updates, the end goal for the development of this game is to have implemented every card released by Wizards of the Coast.
